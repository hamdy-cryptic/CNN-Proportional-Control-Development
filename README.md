# CNN-Proportional-Control-Development
This repository contains all the steps followed during development of the prosthetic hand proportional controller.
The code includes training the model, testing the model, optimizing the model for real time deployment on embedded systems, and testing the model on publicly available datasets.
The model_deployment1 folder is a STM32 Cube IDE project used for testing the deployment of the developed CNN model after optimization to check RAM and Flash size used by the model on a STM32F411 microcontroller.
